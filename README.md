# d7-tinymce-twitter-embed

working with drupal 7 and tinymce 3.58

this is a very simple button that requires a user to paste in a tweet from the embed box twitter. It does very simple validation by making sure that the code starts with <blockquote>.

rename the directory to twembed, enable the module, then enable the button in wysiwyg, and then set the permissions.
